# Python is an object oriented programming language.

# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# To create a class, use the keyword class:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

# class MyClass:
#     x = 5

# Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

# Example
# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

# p1 = MyClass()
# print(p1)

# The __init__() Function
# The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

# class Person:
#   def __init__(self, name, age):
#     self.name = name
#     self.age = age

# p1 = Person("John", 36)

# print(p1.name)
# print(p1.age)

# The __str__() Function
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.

# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:

# class Person:
#   def __init__(self, name, age):
#     self.name = name
#     self.age = age

#   def __str__(self):
#     return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

# p1 = Person("John", 36)

# print(p1)

# Object Methods
# Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

# Let us create a method in the Person class:

# class Person:
#   def __init__(self, name, age):
#     self.name = name
#     self.age = age

#   def myfunc(self):
#     print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

# p1 = Person("John", 36)
# p1.myfunc()

# The self Parameter
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class
