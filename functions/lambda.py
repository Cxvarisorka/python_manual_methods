# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

# Syntax
# lambda arguments : expression
# The expression is executed and the result is returned:

# x = lambda num: num ** 2
# print(x(5))

# Lambda functions can take any number of arguments:

# x = lambda num1, num2: num1 * num2
# print(x(2,5))
